music-theory
====================

Music theory library for Overtone. The long-term goal is to provide libraries for interacting with all sorts of music
theories, not just one. First milestone is Tonal Theory by Westergaard. Next will be interval vectors and set theory.

Ideas
====================
Come up with abbreviated versions of the long function names (as optional alternatives, not to replace
the existing names), to make it easier to type during
livecoding.
